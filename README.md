\# Football Data Pipeline



This project is an \*\*end-to-end football data pipeline\*\* that we are building to collect, process, and analyze football match data in a fully automated and reproducible way. The goal is to create a system that can handle multiple sources, clean and harmonize the data, and provide \*\*analytics-ready outputs\*\* for dashboards and insights.



We are aiming to build a pipeline that:



\* \*\*Automatically collects\*\* football match data from APIs and CSV sources, covering both historical and current seasons.

\* \*\*Cleans and harmonizes\*\* the data to ensure consistency, deduplication, and normalization across sources.

\* \*\*Transforms\*\* the data into analytics-ready models using \*\*dbt\*\*, providing team-level and season-level insights.

\* \*\*Loads the data into a cloud warehouse\*\* (Snowflake) to support queries and dashboards.

\* \*\*Visualizes insights\*\* via Power BI or Jupyter notebooks, allowing detailed exploration of matches, teams, and trends.

\* \*\*Runs fully automatically\*\* with \*\*Airflow\*\*, scheduling extraction, cleaning, and transformation workflows.

\* \*\*Reproducibly executes\*\* in any environment using \*\*Docker\*\*, ensuring the pipeline works locally or in the cloud.



\### What Makes This Project Successful



A successful implementation will provide:



\* Complete and accurate historical and current season data.

\* Clean, standardized, and analytics-ready datasets.

\* Fully automated, repeatable workflows with minimal manual intervention.

\* Easy-to-use outputs for analysis and visualization.



\### Progress So Far (as of 22 August 2025)



\* Data extracted from \*\*API-Football\*\* (2021–22 → 2025–26) and \*\*football-data.org\*\* (2024 → current).

\* Combined CSVs from both sources into structured, source-specific files.

\* Project folder structure, scripts, and GitHub repository setup completed.

\* Planned automation with \*\*Airflow\*\* and reproducibility with \*\*Docker\*\*.



\### Next Steps



1\. \*\*Data Cleaning \& Standardization:\*\* Harmonize columns, deduplicate, and normalize data.

2\. \*\*Load to Snowflake:\*\* Insert cleaned data into cloud tables.

3\. \*\*Transformation with dbt:\*\* Build staging and analytical tables for team and season stats.

4\. \*\*Analytics \& Visualization:\*\* Connect data to Power BI or notebooks for dashboards.

5\. \*\*Full Automation:\*\* Set up Airflow DAGs for scheduled pipeline runs.

6\. \*\*Dockerization:\*\* Containerize the full pipeline for reproducible execution.
